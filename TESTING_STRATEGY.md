# Continue CLI Testing Strategy

## Application Overview

The Continue CLI (`cn`) is a sophisticated AI coding assistant with:

- Interactive TUI and headless modes
- Authentication via WorkOS
- Tool system for file operations
- LLM/API integration with streaming
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- React-based terminal UI via Ink

**Current State**: 11 test files, 270 tests, all passing. Good unit test coverage for utilities and core functions.

## Testing Strategy (Priority Order)

### 1. Integration Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why**: Critical gaps in testing component interactions and CLI workflows

**Components to test**:

- CLI command integration: Test complete `cn`, `cn login`, `cn --config` flows
- Auth flow integration: Login → organization selection → chat initialization
- Tool system integration: Test tool discovery, execution, and error handling
- Configuration loading: Test config file resolution and validation

**Implementation approach**: Use Jest with actual file system and process spawning

### 2. End-to-End CLI Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why**: No current testing of actual CLI behavior users experience

**Components to test**:

- Process-level testing: Spawn CLI process and test stdin/stdout interactions
- Error scenarios: Invalid configs, network failures, auth timeouts
- Session management: Resume functionality, history persistence
- Tool Usage: File operations, terminal commands through actual CLI

**Implementation approach**: Use `@oclif/test` or custom process spawning

### 3. Enhanced Unit Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why**: Fill coverage gaps in core business logic

**Missing coverage areas**:

- Core components: `src/config.ts`, `src/onboarding.ts`, `src/session.ts`
- Error handling: Network timeouts, API failures, malformed responses
- Edge cases: Empty responses, large files, special characters
- React hooks: `useChat.ts`, `useConfigSelector.ts` need testing

**Implementation approach**: Extend existing Jest setup

### 4. Visual/Snapshot Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why**: TUI appearance is critical for user experience

**Components to test**:

- Ink component snapshots: Chat interface, loading states, error displays
- Markdown rendering: Code blocks, formatting, syntax highlighting
- Interactive states: Input prompts, configuration selectors
- Layout testing: Text wrapping, color schemes, responsive behavior

**Implementation approach**: Jest snapshots for Ink components

### 5. Contract/Schema Testing (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why**: External integrations are failure points

**Components to test**:

- LLM API responses: Validate expected response formats
- MCP protocol: Test message formats and error responses
- Configuration schemas: YAML structure validation
- Tool output formats: Standardize tool response structures

**Implementation approach**: Mock external APIs with realistic response validation

### 6. Performance Testing (LOW PRIORITY)

**Why**: CLI responsiveness affects user experience

**Components to test**:

- Streaming response speed: Measure chat response latency
- Large file handling: Test file operations with various sizes
- Memory usage: Monitor memory consumption during long sessions
- Startup time: CLI initialization performance

**Implementation approach**: Custom performance benchmarks

## Implementation Plan

1. **Start with Integration Tests** - Use Jest with actual file system and process spawning
2. **Add CLI E2E Tests** - Use `@oclif/test` for process-level testing
3. **Enhance Unit Coverage** - Focus on `src/commands/`, `src/auth/`, `src/ui/hooks/`
4. **Implement Snapshot Tests** - Use Jest snapshots for Ink components
5. **Add Contract Tests** - Mock external APIs with realistic response validation

## Expected Outcomes

This strategy prioritizes stability through integration and E2E testing while building comprehensive coverage across all critical user paths. The focus on process-level testing will catch issues that unit tests miss, particularly around CLI argument parsing, error handling, and user interaction flows.
