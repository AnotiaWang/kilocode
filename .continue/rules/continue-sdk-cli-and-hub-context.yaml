      This repository is a CLI for the Continue SDK, which provides programmatic
      access to Continue's APIs.


      Key components:

      - Continue SDK: Experimental package in early development, subject to
      breaking changes

      - Continue Hub: Registry for custom AI code agent

      - Hub functionality: Manages agent building blocks (models, rules,
      context providers, prompts, docs, etc.)

      - Governance: Allows central configuration for organizations


      Important libraries:

      - WorkOS: Handles authentication flows

      - Model Context Protocol (MCP): Manages MCP server interactions

      - readline-sync: Provides synchronous CLI user interactions

      - Jest: Used for testing framework


      All code should follow established patterns for a Node.js CLI tool
      interfacing with this experimental SDK.
