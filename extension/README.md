# Continue

**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs) is the open-source autopilot for software development—a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) that brings the power of ChatGPT to your IDE**

## Task, not tab, auto-complete

### Answer coding questions

Highlight sections of code and ask Continue for another perspective
- “how can I set up a Prisma schema that cascades deletes?”
- “where in the page should I be making this request to the backend?”
- “how can I communicate between these iframes?”

### Edit in natural language

Highlight a section of code and instruct Continue to refactor it
- “/edit migrate this digital ocean terraform file into one that works for GCP”
- “/edit change this plot into a bar chart in this dashboard component”
- “/edit rewrite this function to be async”

### Generate files from scratch

Open a blank file and let Continue start new Python scripts, React components, etc.
- “/edit here is a connector for postgres, now write one for kafka”
- “/edit make an IAM policy that creates a user with read-only access to S3”
- “/edit use this schema to write me a SQL query that gets recently churned users”
