**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs) is the open-source autopilot for software development—a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) that brings the power of ChatGPT to your IDE**

## Task, not tab, auto-complete

### Edit in natural language

Highlight a section of code and instruct Continue to refactor it
- `/edit Make this use more descriptive variable names`
- `/edit Rewrite this API call to grab all pages`
- `/edit Use 'Union' instead of a vertical bar here`

### Get possible explainations

Ask Continue about a part of your code to get another perspective
- `/explain what might cause this error?`
- `/explain what is the load_dotenv library name?`
- `/explain how do I find running process on port 8000?`

### Generate files from scratch

Let Continue build the scaffolding of Python scripts, React components, and more
- `Create a shell script to back up my home dir to /tmp/`
- `Write Python in a new file to get Posthog events`
- `Add a React component for syntax highlighted code`
