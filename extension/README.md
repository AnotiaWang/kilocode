# Continue

Automate software development at the level of tasks, instead of tab-autocompletions. With Continue, you can make large edits with natural language, ask questions of your codebase, and run custom recipes built with our open-source Python library.

Get started by opening the command pallet with `cmd+shift+p` and then selecting `Continue: Open Debug Panel`.
