# Continue

**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs) is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

The Continue VS Code extension lets you make edits with natural langauge, ask questions of your codebase, automatically generate unit tests, and more. Beyond the built-in functionality, you can easily write your own recipes to automate the most repetitive sequences of tasks in your workflow.

## Getting Started

Get started by opening the command pallet with cmd+shift+p and then selecting Continue: Open Debug Panel.

To test a few common recipes, open a blank python file and try the following:

- Ask it to "write me a calculator class in python"
- /comment to write comments for the class
- /pytest to write Pytest unit tests in a separate file
- Ask in natural language for a new method

See [here](https://continue.dev/docs/concepts/recipe) for the full list of recipes currently available to use.

You can find the Continue GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)
