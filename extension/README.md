# Continue

Automate software development at the level of tasks, instead of tab-autocompletions. With Continue, you can make large edits with natural language, ask questions of your codebase, and run custom recipes built with our open-source Python library.

Get started by opening the command pallet with `cmd+shift+p` and then selecting `Continue: Open Debug Panel`.

# Features

### Ask a Question

Ask natural language questions of your codebase, like "Where is the entry point to the VS Code extension?"

### Edit with Natural Language

Request an edit to the currently open file, for example: "Add CORS headers to this FastAPI server".

### Generate a Fix

Once Continue has code snippets to work with, it can generate a fix. Just click to accept or reject, or make the tweak you need.

### Stacktrace Parsing

Any stacktrace that appears in your VS Code terminal will be caught by us so we can immediately begin the debugging process. For small bugs that you might have quickly solved, we'll just speed up the process to be nearly instantaneous.

### Generate Unit Tests and Docstrings

Use `cmd+shift+i` to generate a unit test for the function surrounding your cursor position, and `cmd+shift+l` to generate a docstring.
