- The generator reuse thing isn't working it seems

Tests for context:

- You need a static set of files to test. Ideally you don't have to rewrite the exact same files every time you want to make a new test.
- So put some example files in a few folders. There should be a folder for each language I think.
- You should definitely test each of the services separately
