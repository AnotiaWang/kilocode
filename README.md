# Continue

Continue is the open-source autopilot for software developers. Using our SDK you can write short scripts, called recipes, that automate sequences of tasks that are common within your codebase. This repository contains:

- The Continue Python package, which offers an SDK to write recipes and the Continue server, which runs all automations
- The Continue VSCode extension, where you can natively run recipes and use natural language to refine code much faster

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start using Continue is to download our VS Code extension from the marketplace:

[Download for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)

Alternatively, you can build from source. Just clone the repo and run a Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/continuedev/continue && cd continue/extension/scripts && python3 install_from_source.py
```

## Writing Recipes

See our guides on writing recipes in the documentation.
