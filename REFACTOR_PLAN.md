# Reactive Service Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Problem Statement

The current codebase has tightly coupled dependencies (config, apiClient, MCP service, model, etc.) that require full reloads when any component changes. This causes:

1. **Slow startup**: TUI can't start until all components are loaded
2. **Poor UX**: Slash commands like `/org`, `/config` trigger complete restarts
3. **Tight coupling**: Can't change individual components without reloading everything
4. **Blocking initialization**: All dependencies must load before anything works

## Solution Overview

Implement a **Reactive Service Architecture** using:

- Custom ServiceContainer with Node.js EventEmitter
- React hooks for service consumption
- Progressive loading and error handling
- Independent service lifecycle management

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Key Components to Refactor

- **Config Management** (`src/config.ts`, `src/onboarding.ts`)
- **Authentication** (`src/auth/workos.ts`)
- **LLM/Model handling** (`src/config.ts` - `initializeLlmApi()`)
- **MCP Service** (`src/mcp.ts`)
- **API Client** (`src/CLIPlatformClient.ts`)

### Current Initialization Flow

```
chat() -> initializeChat() -> initializeWithOnboarding() -> initialize()
  -> Returns: { config, llmApi, model, mcpService, apiClient }
  -> startTUIChat() with all dependencies
```

### Current Problem Areas

- `src/commands/chat.ts` - `initializeChat()` loads everything synchronously
- `src/ui/index.ts` - `startTUIChat()` requires all deps upfront
- `src/slashCommands.ts` - `/config`, `/login` trigger full reloads via `onReload()`
- `src/ui/TUIChat.tsx` - Assumes all services are available at startup

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Current Initialization into Services âœ… COMPLETE

Create the service infrastructure and extract existing initialization logic.

#### 1.1 Create Service Infrastructure

- [x] Create `src/services/ServiceContainer.ts` - Core service management
- [x] Create `src/hooks/useService.ts` - React hook for service consumption
- [x] Create `src/services/types.ts` - Service-related TypeScript types

#### 1.2 Create Individual Services

- [x] Create `src/services/AuthService.ts` - Extract auth logic from `src/auth/workos.ts`
- [x] Create `src/services/ConfigService.ts` - Extract config logic from `src/config.ts`
- [x] Create `src/services/ModelService.ts` - Extract model initialization
- [x] Create `src/services/MCPServiceWrapper.ts` - Extract MCP logic from `src/mcp.ts`
- [x] Create `src/services/ApiClientService.ts` - Extract API client management

#### 1.3 Create Service Registry

- [x] Create `src/services/index.ts` - Central service registry and initialization
- [x] Add service dependency management (e.g., ModelService depends on ConfigService)

### Phase 2: Make TUI Reactive to Service Changes âœ… COMPLETE

Update the TUI to consume services reactively instead of requiring all deps upfront.

#### 2.1 Update TUI Components

- [x] Update `src/ui/TUIChat.tsx` - Use `useService` hooks instead of props
- [x] Add loading states for individual services
- [x] Add error boundaries for service failures
- [x] Remove service props from component interface

#### 2.2 Update TUI Entry Point

- [x] Update `src/ui/index.ts` - Remove dependency injection, just start TUI
- [x] Update `src/commands/chat.ts` - Start TUI immediately, services load async

#### 2.3 Handle Service Dependencies in UI

- [x] Show progressive loading (e.g., "Config loaded, loading model...")
- [x] Handle missing services gracefully
- [x] Allow partial functionality when some services unavailable

### Phase 3: Update Slash Commands to Use Services âœ… COMPLETE

Make slash commands reactive by updating services instead of triggering reloads.

#### 3.1 Update Slash Command Handlers

- [x] Update `src/slashCommands.ts` - Remove `onReload` callback pattern
- [x] Update `/login` command to use AuthService.login()
- [x] Update `/logout` command to use AuthService.logout()
- [x] Add `/org` command to use AuthService.switchOrg()
- [x] Update `/config` command (handled via ConfigSelector UI)

#### 3.2 Remove Reload Mechanisms

- [x] Remove `onReload` callbacks from TUIChat
- [x] Remove full restart logic from slash commands
- [x] Services now auto-propagate changes to UI

### Phase 4: Add Progressive Loading and Better Error Handling âœ… FUTURE

Enhance the user experience with better loading states and error recovery.

#### 4.1 Enhanced Loading States

- [ ] Add service loading indicators in TUI
- [ ] Show which services are loading/ready
- [ ] Allow using available functionality while other services load

#### 4.2 Error Handling and Recovery

- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed service initialization
- [ ] Add service health monitoring
- [ ] Graceful degradation when services fail
- [ ] Better error messages for specific service failures

#### 4.3 Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Lazy load services only when needed
- [ ] Cache service results appropriately
- [ ] Debounce rapid service changes

## File Changes Required
